<h2>TIM AND TIP;</h2>

<h2>OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A BOY AND A DOG.</h2>

<h3>BY JAMES OTIS, AUTHOR OF "TOBY TYLER," ETC.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span>.</h3>

<h3>TIM'S FLIGHT.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"'STRAYED.&mdash;A boy from the home of the subscriber; and any one
returning him will be suitably rewarded. Said boy is about eleven
years old, has short light hair, a turned-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span> nose, and face very
much tanned. When last seen he had on a suit of blue clothes
considerably faded and worn, and had with him a yellow dog with a
long body, short legs, and a short tail. The boy answers to the
name of Tim, and the dog to that of Tip. Any information regarding
the runaway will be liberally paid for. Address Captain Rufus
Babbige, in care of this office.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"There, Tim," said the man who had been reading the advertisement aloud,
from the columns of a country newspaper, to a very small boy with large
dark eyes and a very pale thin face, who was listening intently, "you
see that Rufe Babbige don't intend to let you get away as easy as you
thought, for he's willing to pay something for any news of you, though
I'll be bound he won't part with very much money."</p>

<p>"But he always said he wished I'd have sense enough to die," replied the
boy, trying to choke down the sob of terror which would rise in his
throat at the idea of being thus advertised for as though he were a
thief; "an' it don't seem to me that there's been a day but what he or
Aunt Betsey have given me a whippin' since my mother died. Look here."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the boy pushed the ragged coat sleeves up from his thin
arms, showing long discolorations which had evidently been made by a
whip-lash.</p>

<p>"It's all over me just like that, an' I don't see what he wants Tip an'
me back for, 'cause he's always said he wished he was rid of us."</p>

<p>"It's a shame to treat a boy that always behaved himself as well as you
did like that," said the proprietor of the country store into which the
runaway had entered to purchase a couple of crackers, "an' I don't see
what the folks up in Selman were thinking of to let him abuse you so. I
don't approve of boys running away, but in your case I think the only
fault is that you didn't run sooner."</p>

<p>"But now that he's put it in the paper, he'll be sure to catch me, for
I'm only six miles from Selman;" and the big tears began to roll down
the boy's cheeks, marking their course by the clean lines they left.</p>

<p>"Folks that know him wouldn't any more think of sending you back to him
than they would of cutting your hand off," said the man, as he shook his
fist savagely in the direction Captain Babbige was supposed to be.</p>

<p>"But what does he want us for, when he's always wanted to get rid of
us?" persisted the boy, stooping down to caress a very queer-looking
dog, whose body seemed to have been stretched out, and whose legs looked
as if they had been worn down by much running.</p>

<p>"I reckon I can tell you why he wants you, Tim, and when you get older
it'll do you some good to know it. He's your uncle, an' your legal
guardian, an' I've been told by them that knows that he's got quite a
sum of money belonging to you, which would all be his if you should die.
Some day, when you are of age, you come back here and claim it; but
don't you let him get hold of you again now."</p>

<p>"Indeed I won't," replied the boy, trembling at the thought of the fate
which would be his if he should be so unlucky as to fall into the
Captain's clutches again.</p>

<p>"Run away from here so far that he can't find you, and when you get a
place where you can go to work, be as good a boy as I've always known
you to be, and you'll come out of this trouble by being a good, honest
man. Here are a couple of dollars for you, and I only wish it was in my
power to take you home with me and keep you. But Rufe Babbige would soon
break that up, and the best thing you can do is to trudge off as fast as
possible."</p>

<p>The boy tried to thank the kind-hearted shop-keeper, but the tears were
coming so fast, and the big sob in his throat had got so far up toward
his mouth, that he could not utter a word.</p>

<p>Just then a customer entered the store, and he hurried away at once,
closely followed by the odd-looking dog, which displayed, in his way,
quite as much affection for the boy as the boy did for him.</p>

<p>Down through the one street of the little village, out on to the country
road, the two walked as if they were already foot-sore and weary; and
when at last they came to where the road wound along through the woods,
Tim sat down on a rock to rest, while Tip huddled up close beside him.</p>

<p>"It's kinder too bad to be called such names in the papers, ain't it,
Tip?" said the boy, speaking for the first time since they had left the
store, "an' I think he ought to be 'shamed of hisself to talk so about
you. It ain't your fault if your legs is short, an' your tail gone;
you're worth more'n all the dogs in this world, an' you're all that I've
got to love me, an' we'll never go back to let Captain Babbige beat us
any more, will we, Tip?"</p>

<p>Just then the dog, which had been chewing some blades of grass, got one
in his nose&mdash;a mishap which caused him to sneeze, and shake his head
vigorously, while Tim, who firmly believed that Tip understood all that
was said to him, looked upon this as a token that the dog agreed with
him, and he continued, earnestly:</p>

<p>"I know just as well as you do, Tip, that it wasn't right for us to run
away, but how could we help it? They kept tellin' us we was in the way,
an' they wished we'd die, an' everybody that was kind to us told us we'd
better do just what we have done. Now we're off in the big, wide world
all by ourselves, Tip, an' whether the Cap'en catches us or not, you'll
love me just as much as you always have, won't you? for you're all I've
got that cares for me."</p>

<p>The dog was still busy trying to settle the question about the grass in
his nose, and after that was decided in his favor, he looked up at his
young master, and barked several times, as if expressing his opinion
about something, which the boy interpreted as advice.</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose you're right, Tip, we ought to go along; for if we
don't, we sha'n't even find a barn to sleep in, as we did last night."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Tim arose wearily from his hard seat, his legs stiff from
long walking, and trudged along, while Tip followed as closely at his
heels as it was possible for him to get.</p>

<p>It was nearly sunset, and as he walked on it seemed as if he was getting
farther into the woods, instead of coming out at some place where he
could find shelter for the night.</p>

<p>"Looks kinder lonesome, don't it, Tip?" and Tim choked back a sob as he
spoke. "I don't want to sleep out here in the woods if I can help it;
but it wouldn't be half so bad as if one of us was alone, would it?"</p>

<p>In this fashion, keeping up a sort of a conversation, if it could be
called such, where one did all the talking, and the other wagged his
short stump of a tail, the two journeyed on until it was almost too dark
to distinguish objects a short distance ahead.</p>

<p>Only once since the store-keeper had given him the two dollars had Tim
thought of what he had said regarding Captain Babbige's having money of
his, and then he put it out of his mind as an impossibility, for surely
he would not have scolded so about what the boy and his dog ate if Tim
had any property of his own.</p>

<p>"I guess we shall have to sleep in the woods, Tip," said Tim,
disconsolately, as the trees appeared to be less thick together, but yet
no signs of a house; "but it won't be much worse than what Aunt Betsey
calls a bed good enough for boys like me."</p>

<p>Just at that instant Tim was frightened out of nearly all his senses,
and Tip was started on a barking match that threatened to shake his poor
apology of a tail from his thin body, by hearing a shrill voice cry out:</p>

<p>"Look here, feller, where are you goin' this time of night?"</p>

<p class="center">Tune&mdash;"For a maid there is no denying." Cavatina (Zerlina), <i>Fra Diavolo</i>. Auber.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Now, Mother Michel, how does my hair thus suit you?</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Beautiful, beautiful, Countess. Of course just like you.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> } <i>together</i> { Oh no, oh no; oh no, no, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Michel</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <i>together</i> { Oh yes, oh yes; oh yes, yes, yes, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>at end of song</i>). Ah, Mother Michel, I fear you are not
sincere. To be sure, my hair is a miracle of handiwork, but
beautiful!&mdash;Ah, Michel!</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Nay, your grace, my words are but too insignificant to express
my admiration.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Well, well, never mind. Listening to flattery may strengthen
my mind for hearing the truth; therefore I will let your speeches pass.
But have you seen Moumouth this morning?</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Ah, yes, madame. Chancing but now to pass the cellar stair, I
beheld that sagacious animal watching, with intensest interest and
quivering tail, a rat hole.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>rapturously</i>). Angelic creature!</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. And I disturbed him not, only called Father Lustucru's
attention to him.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Ah, Michel, that is a great grief to me. Moumouth objects to
Father Lustucru, my steward, who has always been so kind to him.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Yes, alas! never did I see one of your pets so prejudiced
against one of your household.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/ill_003.jpg" width="276" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Do not, I pray, refer to my other pets. And yet there is a
consolation in speaking of their charms. My beautiful green parrot&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Michel</i> (<i>sadly</i>). A victim to cold parsnips.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>weeping</i>). I can never forget how in his dying agonies he
looked reproachfully in my face, and with his usual quickness at
catching up words, cried, "To the mischief with your cold parsnips!" I
can never forget. [<i>Overcome.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Yes, yes, Pompo would always say naughty words. And then there
was Ponto, the ape&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Forbear! forbear! My anguish at finding him cold and drowned
overcomes my heart. [<i>Weeps.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Cheer up, madame; Moumouth still lives, and is happy.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. My constant fear is that he'll die or be killed.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Never fear. How well I remember the day we found him, and your
noble conduct at that time!</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Flattery again, Michel.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i> (<i>warmly</i>). I can not flatter when I speak of that noble act. I
have immortalized it in verse. Will you listen if I repeat it?</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Proceed. For Moumouth's sake I will listen.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A great deal more dead than alive.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>who has listened eagerly</i>). Bravo! bravo! Michel; it is a
beautiful account of my Cat's rescue. I shall have it printed in gold
letters on glazed paper.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Oh, thanks. Now you flatter <i>me</i>. But that reminds me. Father
Lustucru gave me a letter for you this morning, which I forgot to
deliver. [<i>Presents letter on a salver.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. A letter? Ah! 'tis from my sister. [<i>She reads.</i>] Oh,
Heaven! my sister is ill&mdash;has broken her leg&mdash;and writes to me to come
to her. Michel, I faint. [<i>She faints.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Michel</i> (<i>fanning violently</i>). Madame, madame, for your sister's sake,
revive. [<i>Applies salts.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>recovering</i>). Now I am better; but, oh, Michel, to be thus
torn from my home and my Cat, to rush to the suffering, is indeed sad.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. I have no words with which to express my sympathy.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. I must go immediately. Go, Michel, bring my bonnet and
shawl, and order the carriage. [<i>Exit</i> Michel <i>and returns, bringing

charmer; let me once more embrace him.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Ah, madame, if you could spare him this sad parting! Think of
his delicate nerves, his sensitive heart, and spare him this hour of
agony. Believe me, he shall be well attended to for your sake, my loved
mistress.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i>. Yes, yes, I see the wisdom of this sacrifice, dear Michel.
Moumouth shall not be broken-hearted by an anguished parting. Only care
for him tenderly. And now, farewell.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i> (<i>overcome</i>). Farewell, most beloved mistress, most beautiful

<h3>ACT II.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>.&mdash;Lustucru's <i>room</i>. Lustucru <i>discovered sitting at table in
a happy mood</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. At last! at last! I have not waited in vain; fortune has
smiled upon my efforts, and rewarded my patience. The Countess has gone
to her sister, and only stupid Mother Michel remains. No one saw me
seize that wretched Cat last night and put him in the basket; no one saw
my joyful dance around my treasure, and no one saw my look of bliss when
I flung the Cat from the high bridge down, down into the great river.
Mother Michel receive five hundred francs in reward for care of that
Cat! I think not. Wretched, ungrateful beast! I am at rest now, I
breathe freely: Moumouth is dead; revenge is mine. Ah! here comes
Michel, looking, no doubt, for our Cat.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Good-morning, Lustucru; but have you seen Moumouth this
morning? In vain have I searched for him.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. Does your Cat ever come where I am? You know he hates me.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Alas! where is he? I left him last night by the parlor fire,
and now I can not find him.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i> (<i>slyly</i>). Can he be lost?</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Ah, no, no! it is impossible. He is somewhere in the house.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. He ought to be found. [<i>With feigned anxiety.</i>] He ought to
be searched for this instant. Moumouth is a precious animal, whose value
makes it well worth the search. Let us search for him.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Alas! I left him only an instant.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. I begin to believe that he is lost. It is a great misfortune
for you. The Countess&mdash;what will she say when she returns? She is
capable of turning you out of doors.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i> (<i>indignant</i>). Turn me out of doors! Father Lustucru, do you

dear tail, then looked once more at me, and&mdash;[<i>sobs</i>]&mdash;and&mdash;[<i>sobs</i>]</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). And died?</p>

will return soon, and she hopes to find Moumouth well, and that she has
reserved for me a handsome reward.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i> (<i>still pacing the room</i>). Ho!</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. But since Moumouth refuses your hash, Father Lustucru, I think
I shall taste it, to set Moumouth an example. It looks very nice.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). Don't touch it, I beg of you.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Why not? Is there anything wrong in the hash?</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. No, certainly not; but what is prepared for a cat should not
serve for a Christian. It is necessary to guard propriety, and not
trifle with the dignity of human nature.</p>

<p><i>Michel</i>. Very well; Moumouth may suit himself. But I can not believe
your hash is so <i>very</i> nice, or Moumouth would not have refused it.</p>

<p><i>Lustucru</i>. Do not reflect on my hash, madame, because your Cat objects
to it. Moumouth never <i>had</i> good taste.</p>

<i>you</i>. <i>I</i> think he has very good taste; he adores <i>me</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="BLOCKADED_BY_A_LION" id="BLOCKADED_BY_A_LION">BLOCKADED BY A LION.</a></h2>

<h3>BY DAVID KER.</h3>

<p>"Now, monsieur," says old Major De Launay, pointing to the vast jungle
of monstrous reeds fringing the African coast far as the eye can reach,
as the Tunis steamer heads seaward out of Bona Harbor, "if you want some
sport, take a gun and go in among those reeds, and you may be sure of
not having long to wait before you find yourself face to face with a
lion."</p>

<p>"A lion?" echo I. "Why, I thought they had all been killed off long
ago."</p>

<p>"So they have everywhere else along the coast; but just here, as you
see, it's a wild kind of country, and Monsieur Yellowmane has it all his
own way. There are plenty of brave fellows among our Arabs here, and we
Frenchmen don't consider ourselves cowards; but I can tell you that you
won't find a man in all this district, Arab or Frenchman, who would go
through those reeds after night-fall&mdash;no, not if you were to offer him a
thousand francs."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you do it yourself, then, M. De Launay?" ask I, rather
surprised at such an avowal from a man whose reckless courage is a
proverb throughout the length and breadth of Algeria.</p>

<p>"No, that I wouldn't," answers the old soldier, emphatically. "I've
tried it once already, and I can promise you I won't easily forget how
<i>that</i> adventure ended. Would you like to hear the story? Well, then,
here it is for you:"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span></p>

<p>Some thirty years ago, when I was a good deal nimbler than I am now (and
a good deal sillier too, I'm afraid), a lot of us were quartered at
Bona, with nothing much to do except taking charge of some stores; and
as always happens with young officers when there's not enough duty on
hand to keep them steady, we weren't long in getting into mischief. One
day at mess somebody brought up this story of the reed jungle, and how
no one dared go into it, and we all began joking each other about who
should be the man to face the lions.</p>

<p>"De Launay's the one to do it!" cried Alphonse St. Foix, a young
sub-lieutenant. "He's afraid of nothing. Don't you remember how he led
the assault at Constantine?"</p>

<p>"It would hardly be a fair trial, though," said our senior Major, in his
polite way; "for the lions would undoubtedly let him pass as one of
themselves."</p>

<p>"Or if he were to put on a lion's hide," chimed in Claude Latour (who
must have his joke, whatever happened), "they'd never find him out so
long as he didn't bray."</p>

<p>At that there was a general laugh, which put me out so much that (more
shame for me) I fairly lost my temper.</p>

<p>"Well," cried I, springing up, "for that one word I'll go and do the
thing this very night, and <i>then</i> it shall be seen which of us is the
lion, and which the ass."</p>

<p>"Agreed! agreed!" shouted all, clapping their hands, and hallooing like
madmen.</p>

<p>But poor Claude looked quite chop-fallen, for he had never intended to
push the joke so far, and the moment we rose from table he came up to me
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Henri," said he, "don't go and get yourself killed
just for that foolish joke of mine, which I ought to have bitten my
tongue off sooner than utter. I never dreamed you'd take it so
seriously, and I'm heartily sorry to have vexed you."</p>

<p>I answered not a word, but just looked him straight in the eyes for a
moment, and then turned my back and walked off. Many a time have I been
sorry for it since then, for the poor fellow was killed by those
rascally Kabyles (Arabs) a few months later; but one always repents of
these things too late.</p>

<p>Well, night came at last, and every officer who wasn't on duty turned
out to see me start. It had been arranged that I was to set off a little
after midnight, and that my comrades were to see me into the jungle at a
point close to the sea, and then come to meet me about sunrise at
another point farther inland. The whole length of my circuit through the
reeds would be only a little over two miles, but this, in a tract where
one step was generally supposed to be certain death, was thought quite
sufficient.</p>

<p>I took my double-barrelled rifle and hunting knife (not that <i>they</i>
could be much good against a whole jungle of lions), and the moment our
watches pointed to half past twelve, off we started. I couldn't help
thinking as we went along that there could hardly have been a worse
night for the purpose, so far as <i>I</i> was concerned. The night was so
still that you might have heard a step hundreds of yards away, and the
full moon gave light enough to make out the smallest print of a
newspaper, let alone the figure of a man. But, as we say, "when you've
broken the shell, you must eat the egg"; so I kept my thoughts to
myself, and tramped on.</p>

<p>It was a pretty long march, and a difficult too, down to the place for
which we were bound. By the time we got there it was two o'clock,
leaving less than two hours before sunrise. At last the great reed
forest began to rise before us, shadowy and spectral in the moonlight.
My comrades shook me by the hand, and wished me good-speed. In another
moment the reeds had closed behind me.</p>

<p>Just at first I didn't feel it so much, for the excitement of the
adventure kept me up; and, besides, I had quite enough to do in picking
my way along, the reeds being a good deal higher than my head, and very
nearly as thick as a man's wrist. But when the first excitement began to
wear off, <i>then</i> it all came upon me at once, just like the shock of a
shower-bath. Every time a reed rustled I seemed to feel the sharp teeth
in my flesh already; and indeed it's a wonder how I ever escaped, for I
could hear them moving on every side of me; but somehow or other none of
them offered to touch me.</p>

<p>On I went&mdash;on, on, on&mdash;until I seemed to have done ten miles instead of
two. In fact, I afterward found that I had gone far beyond the
prescribed distance; but what could I do, with the reed-tops shutting
out the very sky, until sometimes I had hardly any moon to steer by? At
last the reeds began to grow thinner, and presently, just as I was
getting fairly tired out, forth I came on to the open plain, with the
first gleam of daybreak just dawning in the eastern sky.</p>

<p>Then I discovered, to my very great disgust, that instead of striking
the point where my comrades were to meet me, I had gone ever so far
beyond it.</p>

<p>"Well," thought I, "there's time enough yet, at all events, before
sunrise. I'll just sit down and rest for five minutes, and then walk
back to the meeting-place."</p>

<p>So down I sat upon a rock, and, as you might expect, was fast asleep
directly.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I slept; but I awoke suddenly with that uneasy
feeling which you sometimes have when somebody stands by your bedside
and looks fixedly down upon you as you sleep. And sure enough somebody
was looking fixedly down upon me; for when my eyes opened they rested
upon the biggest lion I'd ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>I took in the full horror of the situation at a glance. My gun had slid
down over the smooth rock, and was lying fully six feet away, with the
beast right between me and it. My comrades, even if they hadn't got
tired of waiting and gone home (as they most likely had), were too far
off to be summoned by any shout. Add to this that I was already parched
with thirst, and that the sun was mounting, and making the rock on which
I lay hotter and hotter every moment, and you'll have some idea of the
nice predicament that I was in.</p>

<p>It's an awkward confession for an old soldier to make, but I must admit
that I fairly lost my head. All hope of escaping went out of my mind at
once; my only thought was to throw myself upon the lion, and get it over
as soon as possible. But as I put my hand behind me to raise myself up,
it struck against a big stone.</p>

<p>In a moment, as if some one had spoken it in my ear, I got the idea of a
device that might save me yet. I clutched the stone, and keeping it well
behind my back (for I knew that any sudden movement would bring the lion
upon me at once), jerked it from me so as to let it fall among the
reeds. At the crash that it made, the lion turned like lightning, and
gave a spring in that direction, and I gave another, right across the
rock to where my gun was lying. I had barely seized it, when the beast
turned upon me.</p>

<p>After that it was all like a confused dream. The rush of the huge tawny
body, the glare of the yellow eyes into mine, and the hot, foul breath
steaming on my face, the flash and crack of my piece, the lion's hoarse,
bubbling growl, and the report of my second barrel, seemed all to come
together. I remember nothing distinctly until I found myself leaning
upon my rifle, sick and dizzy, as if I'd fallen out of a window, with
the lion dead at my feet.</p>

<p>Just then my comrades, startled by the shots, came running up. I was
glad <i>then</i> that they hadn't seen me in my difficulty, although I
wouldn't have thought it an intrusion, a few minutes before, if the
whole French army had come up in a body. They praised me up to the
skies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span> insisted on carrying off the skin as a trophy. But when our
old Colonel heard the story, he shook his head, and looked at me in a
way that made me feel rather ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>"M. De Launay," said he, very gravely, "to risk one's life in the cause
of duty is the act of a brave man; to risk it uselessly, for the sake of
a mere boast, is that of a fool. Always remember that in future."</p>

<p>And I <i>have</i> remembered it ever since.</p>

<h2><a name="RABBITS_AS_PETS" id="RABBITS_AS_PETS">RABBITS AS PETS.</a></h2>

<p>As a matter of course all boys and girls love pets, and the number they
own is probably only limited by the space which their parents are
willing they should devote to such purposes.</p>

<p>But very many boys are too liable, after they have had their pets a few
days, and the novelty has worn off, to neglect them, and the little
prisoners suffer more from want of care than, when they were first
brought to their new home, they did from too much attention.</p>

<p>If your parents have decided that you can keep pets, do not get too
many, for fear that they will need more of your time than you will be
willing to give; and then be careful that you care for them properly,
first learning what they need.</p>

<p>Since rabbits are more easily cared for than almost any other kind of
animals, and can be procured more easily and cheaply, repaying their
owner for his care by producing a large number of young ones, it may be
a favor to many to tell just how these pets can best be kept.</p>

<p>In England, where a great many men keep rabbits, and raise young ones in
order to produce as many and as peculiar kinds as possible, one is able
to buy all the fancy varieties, each of which is known by the manner in
which the ears are carried. One kind is known as the "oar lop ears,"
another as the "horn lop," and the most expensive as the "real or
perfect lop," where the ears hang straight down each side of the face.
Then in these fancy varieties of rabbits the chin must be formed in a
certain way, and the back must arch so that it is carried at least two
inches higher than the head.</p>

<p>In that country very high prices are paid for what is called a perfectly
formed animal; but since the habits are the same whether the ears hang
down properly, or the back is sloped instead of arched, a pair of common
white pink-eyed rabbits will afford quite as much pleasure as an
expensive pair which do not look nearly as pretty, except to those who
make a study of the animal.</p>

<p>Rabbits can be bought from almost any dealer in pets; but before making
a selection the most important thing is to build a house for them, in
order to have everything ready for their reception when they arrive.</p>

<p>Some boys seem to think that there is excuse enough for keeping their
pets in a small box or barrel if they say that is the only place they
have; but it is worse than no excuse, since they should give up the
pleasure of owning animals if they can not care for them properly.</p>

<p>Rabbits need plenty of exercise, and that can be given in a limited
amount of space provided the house, or hutch, be built in a manner to
attain that object. A good one, suitable for from four to six rabbits,
can be made by almost any boy who has any idea of using a hammer and
saw. Build a box four feet square, three feet high at one side, and
three feet six inches high at the other side, which provides for a
sloping roof. Make the top nine inches larger all around, in order to
have a projection which shall shelter the gimlet holes that are to be
made for purposes of ventilation along the top of the sides.</p>

<p>Fasten the top or roof on with a pair of stout hinges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span> at the upper or
higher side, which will enable you to look in at the chambers of the
house, and also to clean them. Any kind of a fastening may be used to
hold it down when closed, and if there is any danger of the inmates
being stolen, a staple and padlock serve the double purpose of
protection and safety from their various enemies.</p>

<p>The hutch should be divided by a flooring about half way up, in order to
give a dining-room and sleeping-room story. The upper portion should be
connected with the lower by a hole cut in the floor, about six inches
square, with a narrow strip of board laid at as much of an angle as the
width of the building will permit. The lower story is to be used as a
dining and sitting room, and holes should be bored in the floor, about
two inches apart, in order that the water may run off, while a door from
six to eight inches square should be made in one corner of the building,
to communicate with the yard, which should be built of laths firmly
imbedded in the earth. The upper floor is to be divided into four rooms
of equal size, each one connected with the others by openings cut
through the partitions, about six inches square.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/ill_015.jpg" width="192" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A PET RABBIT.</span>
</div>

<p>Such a house may be made of rough boards; and with a medium-sized yard,
where the rabbits can run during the day, they will be as contented and
happy as possible. But their owner may not be quite as happy regarding
them, since it will be only possible to see them while they are in the
yard or by raising the roof of the house. To obviate this, the entire
front of the house can be formed of lattice-work made of planed laths.
If this is done, a shutter made like the sides of the house must be
provided, so that the building can be closed during a storm or in cold
weather.</p>

<p>Fill the chambers half full of hay; have a neat little drinking-trough
just outside the door in the yard; and then procure your pets.</p>

<p>If you are anxious to raise young rabbits enough to provide all your
friends with pets, get two or three females and one male. It is better
that you get pure white ones, since those which are spotted are neither
as cleanly nor as nice-looking.</p>

<p>In a day or two after they have been introduced to their new house they
will be perfectly at home, and whether they thrive well or not depends
entirely on you.</p>

<p>They are by no means dainty as to what they eat, provided it is green or
vegetable food. Cabbage, lettuce, or turnip leaves, clover tops, carrots
with the tops on, a little barley or oatmeal, corn or hay, makes up the
full bill of fare for them.</p>

<p>Although some people say that rabbits require no water, it is better to
be on the safe side, and give them plenty. It is true that they need but
little during the summer, when they are fed almost entirely on green
food; but in the winter, when they are living on hay and vegetables that
have been stored, they certainly need as much liquid as other pets.</p>

<p>When the female has young&mdash;and she will have ten litters a year&mdash;she
should have plenty of oatmeal and milk. Do not trouble or handle her at
such times; but let her have her own way until the young are eight weeks
old, when they should be taken from her, and put into a yard or hutch by
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span></p>

<p>Be sure of one thing, boys, before you decide upon keeping any kind of
pets&mdash;be perfectly certain that you are willing to devote to them all
the time necessary to care for them, not feeding them too much for a few
days, and then neglecting them almost entirely. Once positive that you
are willing to do this, get all the pets your parents are willing you
should keep, and you will find no slight degree of enjoyment in
attending to the wants of the little fellows who are dependent on you.</p>

<h2><a name="DIGGING_FOR_INDIAN_RELICS" id="DIGGING_FOR_INDIAN_RELICS">DIGGING FOR INDIAN RELICS.</a></h2>

<h3>BY S.&nbsp;L. FREY.</h3>

<p>In ancient times it was the custom to place in the grave or the tomb
with the dead whatever had been most prized during life, perhaps with
the idea that it could be carried by the spirit of the departed on its
long journey to the unknown land. Whether we open the old graves of
Greeks or Ph&oelig;nicians, Germans, Norse vikings, Britons, Celts, or
North American Indians, we are indebted to this early custom for much
knowledge and light thrown upon the life of all these ancient peoples by
the implements and ornaments that we find.</p>

<p>All the early nations and savage tribes have had much to do with war and
hunting, and in the old graves we find many remains of their weapons.
The very swords and spears used by Agamemnon, King of men, that some of
you no doubt are reading about now in the Iliad, were found by Dr.
Schliemann in the tombs at Mycenæ; and in France not long since a great
tomb was opened, where long ago some fierce fighter had been buried with
his armor on, his sword by his side, and with him his noble war-horse
that had carried him through many a fierce battle.</p>

<p>You have many of you read of the Northmen, who a good many hundred years
ago were the cause of so much trouble to the people of England and
France, coming down from Scandinavia, and burning and stealing, and
laying waste all the coasts. We know what kind of vessels these people
sailed in; but it is a great deal better to actually see one for
ourselves, as we can now, for it was only last year that one of these
queer ships was dug out of a mound, which was the tomb of some great
viking or chief. I think that Rollo and William the Conqueror and the
human life of that age would seem more real to us if we could sit on one
of the seats of that old vessel.</p>

<p>And so it is in this country. All the boys and girls have read about the
Indians, and heard many stories of the life they led all over this broad
land when our forefathers first came here, and many have seen the stone
arrow-heads and other implements that the Indians used, and have
themselves picked up these things that are scattered over the fields so
abundantly in some places; but I doubt if there are any of you who have
opened an old grave, and been astonished at the strange and curious
treasures it contained. It is always hard to find these places in this
country, where for the most part there are no monuments of any kind to
mark the spot where the Indians buried their dead. If we could find them
all, it would be an easy matter to fill a large museum at once, for the
most finished and best preserved of these things are always found in the
graves. I have found a few of these places, and they always contain
relics of great interest. I once took from a single grave 189
arrow-heads, which seemed to indicate that the man was a great warrior,
or perhaps one of the ancient arrow-makers.</p>

<p>But what I particularly want to tell you about now is the opening of
some graves containing not only articles of Indian make, but also many
other things that had been brought in by the white people when they
first began to trade with the Indians.</p>

<p>This grave-yard was upon a side-hill that looked down upon the winding
Mohawk and the rich intervales that line its banks. It was known to the
boys of several generations as a place where they could pick up curious
beads after the spring rains; and on a wet day in November I started off
on a buckboard wagon, with a hoe and a spade, to see what I could dig
up. As there were so many beads on the surface, I wanted to see what
there was below. There was a hop-yard covering the whole hill, so I
commenced by opening a trench between two rows of hops, and had dug but
a few inches when I found a dozen or more red and white glass tubes
about as large and long as a common slate-pencil. At a depth of three
feet I came to the first grave.</p>

<p>Now at first thought it may not seem a proper thing to do, to disturb
the bones of a man, even though he be a savage, and has lain in the
earth hundreds of years; but we may want very much to know what manner
of men they were, these early inhabitants of our country, and may
perhaps be able to find this out, more or less, from their skulls and
bones, and the things we find buried with them. So I carefully removed
the earth with a knife, and found a great variety of glass beads. There
had evidently been a grand necklace made of them; they were round and
oval and octagonal, and of various colors&mdash;red and amber-colored and
blue and green. They had no doubt been brought to America by some Dutch
trader, as beads of this kind have been made at Venice for several
hundred years, and are still made for trading with the savages of Africa
and our Western Indians. Before the white traders came, the savages made
their beads of bone and stone and sea-shells, for they were very fond of
ornaments, and took great pains to secure jewels of some kind.</p>

<p>I took out a hundred or more of these beads, and also an oval tube of
catlinite, or red pipe-stone, which is a peculiar stone much used by the
natives for pipes and beads, and is only found in Minnesota. But this
was only the beginning of the finds I made. To the Indian all things
animate and inanimate were endowed with a spirit, and the idea seemed to
be that the spirit of the ornament, or utensil, or weapon went with the
spirit of the man on the long journey to the happy hunting grounds.</p>

<p>The next thing I found was a white clay pipe with the letters R.&nbsp;T.
stamped on the bowl, and this was one of the things that enabled me to
determine the age of the place; for as R.&nbsp;T. probably stood for Richard
Tyler, a celebrated maker of pipes about 1650, I could pretty safely
conclude that some time during the latter half of the seventeenth
century these things had been brought to America. Continuing to throw
out the earth toward the foot of the grave (for the man had been buried
with the beads around his neck, and the pipe in his hand), I found one
triangular copper arrow-head&mdash;all that remained of the bow and arrows
that were buried with him. A rude iron axe and a hoe next came to light.
Axes of this kind are quite common on the sites of the more recent
Indian villages; they have a peculiar mark, and were probably made at
Utrecht.</p>

<p>At the foot of the grave I found a small copper kettle, and a rude iron
hook to suspend it over the fire, and also what was by far the most
interesting and valuable of the relics, a salt-glazed earthen jug of the
kind known to collectors of ceramics as Grès de Flanders. It was without
crack or flaw, and is an interesting specimen of this early pottery.
Upon it are various devices stamped in the clay, the most prominent of
which are two remarkably slim lions with enormous heads; the outlines of
the designs and the lines encircling the jug are bright blue.</p>

<p>The kettle and jug were upside down, and in the former was the hollow
shell of a small pumpkin or gourd. This, I think, is by far the oldest
pumpkin to be found anywhere; it must be as old as the one that Peter,
Peter, the pumpkin-eater, imprisoned his wife in.</p>

<p>Some other things in the grave were a rusty gun-barrel, seven copper
kettles, two English pipes, an Indian clay pipe, a whetstone, about two
thousand beads, fifty large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span> wampum beads, two thimbles, a jew's-harp, a
bear's tooth, a long bone tube, two earthen jars of native manufacture
(one of them smaller than a tea-cup), and a rosary with a brass
cross&mdash;seeming to indicate that the Jesuit missionaries had reached
these people before this warrior died.</p>

<p>With all these relics, one can form some idea as to what manner of men
lived on the sunny hill-sides and by the shores of our rivers before
civilization came to take possession of their hunting grounds, and drive
them from their homes.</p>

<h2><a name="A_BIT_OF_FOOLISHNESS" id="A_BIT_OF_FOOLISHNESS">A BIT OF FOOLISHNESS.</a></h2>

<h3>BY SARAH O. JEWETT.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part I</span>.</h3>

<p>When Jack and Alice Denfield's mother heard the story of this adventure
of theirs, she was much annoyed at first, and thought they must have
been in a good deal of danger. Afterward, when she was convinced that
they came to no harm but very slight colds, she laughed at them
heartily, and said it had been a good lesson, and if she had been twenty
years younger she probably should have enjoyed it as much as they did.</p>

<p>They had all three been staying at the White Mountains; they had planned
to be at the Glen House through July and early August, and then go to
the sea-shore to stay until late in September. But the very first of
August Mrs. Denfield found that she must go to Boston for a few days to
attend to some business; and they were all sorry, for they had counted
upon having a week or ten days more among the mountains. They had had a
most satisfactory time, for they knew a charming set of people at the
hotel, and every pleasant day there had been long drives or walks, small
fishing parties or large picnics. Jack and Alice always were glad to be
together; they were very near the same age, and had always been great
cronies from their babyhood. They were equally fond of out-of-door life;
Jack had said more than once that his sister was exactly as good company
as another fellow, and she responded that she did not have such good
times with anybody else in the world. I think it is seldom one sees such
a friendship between a brother and sister. They both had a great many
friends, but they were always delighted to have vacation come, and get
back to each other.</p>

<p>They came in late to supper one Monday evening. They had been out all
day, and it was their last chance for a long expedition, for they were
to go down by the stage the next day to take the train. For a little
while Jack was uncommonly silent, and did not pay much attention to the
chattering of the other young people at the table; but suddenly he said
to Alice, who happened to sit next him, "I have made a plan"; and she
stopped to listen to it with great interest. "Suppose we ask mamma to
let us stay here a little longer, and then go down to Boston by
ourselves? She will have to be there for a week, she told me, and we
could go up Mount Washington with the Eastfields and Dunns. You know
they're going to walk up the mountain, and stay all night. It'll be
great fun."</p>

<p>Alice was delighted at the idea, and after supper was over they went at
once to propose this change of plans.</p>

<p>"I do not know why not," said Mrs. Denfield, slowly. "You are surely
familiar enough with travelling, and almost grown up, at any rate, you
tall creatures! But you must not take any longer journey" (they had all
three wished to go farther up among the mountains); "you must be in
Boston Saturday evening."</p>

<p>So next day Mrs. Denfield started off by herself, and Alice said, just
after the stage had gone, "I wish we had asked mamma if we could not
walk part of the way; we could send our trunks on by the stage to North
Conway."</p>

<p>Jack's eyes began to shine with delight. "Of course she wouldn't mind,"
said the boy. "Don't you remember how sorry she was when you couldn't go
down through the Notch with the rest of us last summer, because you had
sprained your ankle? Let's do it, Alice. We can go up Mount Washington
to-morrow, and come down next day. Yes, there will be just time enough
to reach Boston Saturday night. Why, it's nothing to do; we have walked
almost as far a dozen times."</p>

<p>"But not by ourselves," said Alice, "in such a wild country. I'm not a
bit afraid, though&mdash;you needn't think that."</p>

<p>So they made their plans, and kept them great secrets, for Jack said
that everybody would insist upon going with them, and making a public
occasion of it, and it would be much better fun to go alone by
themselves. They had often taken short excursions together, and they
knew that they could get on much faster. It was settled that they were
to start early Friday morning, and to say good-by to everybody the
evening before, and then go away even before any one would be down to
see them start by the stage.</p>

<p>The walking party up Mount Washington was a grand success, and the
afternoon and evening of the day were just the right sort of weather,
cool and fresh and bright, with a most glorious sunset, and a clear
though very late moonrise. But next morning it was damp and cloudy, and
most of the party thought it would be more sensible to drive back to the
Glen instead of walking. They found that the clouds were only around the
tops of the high mountains, and that it was really a pleasant day, after
all, when they reached the valley; and after they had told the story of
their expedition, the party scattered itself about the piazzas and rooms
of the hotel, and Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span> presently went to find Alice, and asked her
eagerly why it would not be a good plan to take half their journey that
day, and the rest the next, and spend the night somewhere on the road.
Then they would have more time in North Conway, for there were some
friends there whom they both wished to see.</p>

<p>"We will start by the stage just after dinner, and ride a little way,
and then get down," Jack told his sister; and Alice at once hurried off
to finish their packing, and to say good-by to her friends.</p>

<p>They meant to go ten or twelve miles that afternoon. Jack was sure he
remembered the road perfectly, and knew where they could find lodgings
for the night. Some one found out that they were going afoot, and said
that it was a capital day for it; but the long climb up the mountain the
day before seemed to have tired almost everybody but themselves, and no
one offered to accompany them except two or three of their cronies, who
strolled along with them for half a mile or so.</p>

<p>Our friends were in the highest spirits, and started off at last side by
side without a fear, keeping step and looking around at each other every
few minutes to smile and say what fun it was. Jack had a traveller's bag
slung over his shoulders with a strap, and Alice carried a little
lunch-box and her light jacket, and they both had the sticks which they
had carried on all their tramps about the mountains. They felt like
people who were journeying in earnest, and were not merely out for a
stroll.</p>

<p>They were both capital walkers; they had had good practice during the
last few weeks at the Glen, and they went gayly down the road for the
first few miles without taking much thought of anything but the mere
pleasure of walking. There had been a good many rains, and the streams
were full, and the foliage was as fresh and green as if it were the
first of June. The mountains stood up grand and tall, and there was not
a cloud to be seen.</p>

<p>"It is even clearer than yesterday," said Alice. "I am sorry we are not
just coming to the mountains instead of just going away. Jack! there
must be trout in that brook."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking of that," said the boy. "Here is a line in my
pocket; I mean to cut a little pole and rig it, and go up the hill a
little way. You could be resting."</p>

<p>But Alice disdained the idea of being tired, and sat down to wait in a
most comfortable place under a pine-tree. "I wish there was another
line," she said. "I put all my tackle in my trunk before we thought of
letting mamma go on without us."</p>

<p>Jack was soon ready, and pushed in through the bushes, and in the
silence that everything kept but the brook, his sister could hear him
for a few minutes as he went on from point to point, sometimes snapping
the dead branches that he stepped upon. It was growing warmer, and she
was, after all, not sorry to sit still for a little while. She called to
Jack once or twice to be sure he had not gone too far away, and he
whistled in answer, softly, as if there might be some chance of a trout,
and at last he did not answer at all.</p>

<p>Alice looked at the mountains, and pulled an envelope out of her pocket
and began to make a little sketch of a strange old tree the other side
of the road, and she did not hurry about it; so after she had finished
it she said to herself that Jack had been gone long enough. There was no
possible danger of his losing his way, but it was long past the middle
of the afternoon already, and they must go on. So she whistled again and
again the odd little call with which Jack was very familiar, but he did
not answer. He had evidently gone a good way up from the road; and she
shouted, but he did not shout to her, and she said to herself that it
was very wrong of him, and that there was no more fishing to be done on
that journey out of sight of the road. She grew very worried at last,
and annoyed as well; the mosquitoes had grown troublesome, and she did
not like staying there alone for so long; and the thought seized her
that her brother must have fallen over the rocks and hurt himself badly,
for it was over an hour since he had gone away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span></p>

<p>She followed the brook up its bed for some distance, and at last she
heard the bushes rustling, and called eagerly, and there was Jack, safe
and sound, with three or four good-sized trout on a birch twig.</p>

<p>"There are the best trout I have caught this summer," said he,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>And Alice forgot to scold him at first, she was so pleased. "We must
have them for our supper," she told the proud fisherman; and they
hurried back to the roadside.</p>

<p>"I haven't been gone long, have I?" asked Jack, persuasively. "I hated
to turn back, you know."</p>

<p>And Alice said that they must hurry; it was already nearly five, and
they had five or six miles further to go to the house where they were to
spend the night.</p>

<p>But Jack was hot and tired, and said he must have some biscuits, and
rest a few minutes. It was so bright a day that it would not be dark
early. And who cared if it were? The road was straight and safe enough,
and it would be much cooler after the sun went down a little. It was
really very hot, and Alice was satisfied, now that he had come back, and
she made no objection when he had finished his lunch, and had taken a
drink of the cold brook water, and threw him self down to rest.</p>

<p>"You have been sitting still here while I have been going up the side of
the hill," said he. "No wonder that you are ready to go on."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/ill_016.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="" />
<span class="caption">"I WISH A STAGE WOULD COME BY."</span>
</div>

<p>Alice wrapped the trout in some great beech leaves, and tied a bit of
fish-line round them. One was unusually large, and Jack was very proud
of it, and told her what a hard time he had in catching it, and how it
came very near going into the brook again after he had fairly landed it.
After a while they got up unwillingly and set off again. The sun was
almost down behind the mountains, but the air seemed to grow hotter, and
hotter, although they were in the shade. The leaves were perfectly still
on the trees; there did not seem to be a breath of wind.</p>

<p>"I don't think this is very good fun," said Jack, angrily; and Alice
laughed, but she thought that pedestrianism in hot weather was not so
full of pleasure as it might be.</p>

<p>"I wish a stage would come by," she said, laughingly. And when they met
one bound for the Glen a little later, I think they were both tempted to
hail it and take passage.</p>

<p>Jack whistled manfully, and they both made fun of themselves, but the
little knapsack which Jack carried was not the trifling weight it seemed
at first. It was as heavy as lead; and he wondered what was in it, and
shifted it to the other shoulder and back again with a manner as if he
did not like to carry it at all. "It must have been the tramp yesterday
that makes us so fagged," said he. "We have walked so very far, you
know. I say! look at those clouds coming over. It's going to rain.
There's going to be a tremendous shower. What had we better do?"</p>

<p>But Alice did not know. "Go on, I suppose," said she, "as fast as we
can. Very likely some one will drive by. Somehow I never thought of its
raining."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," answered Jack, dismally. "I wish I had not stopped for
the trout: that took up so much time. But aren't they beauties?" and he
held them up for consolation. The leaves about them were already wilted,
and the colors of the fish looked dull. "I wish I had my little scales
here," said Jack; "I took them out of my pocket only yesterday."</p>

hind-legs. We play hide-and-seek together, and I tell Gypsy to go
up stairs while I hide. When I call her, she runs down as fast as
she can, gives a little turn at the bottom of the stairs, and then
hunts till she finds me. She is very fond of ice-cream. Sometimes I

night, when I come home, I shout, "Has <span class="smcap">Young People</span> come?" and last
week I had fidgets from Monday till Thursday. I always get the
fidgets on Monday, and sometimes on the Thursday after it has come,
I like it so much. The Post-office Box is my favorite; then comes
Jimmy Brown, and then "The Cruise of the 'Ghost.'" I collect postal
cards only, because they are samples of the printing done in
different countries and times. I send cards I printed myself at
father's office. I have sold 125 kites this month.</p></blockquote>

<p>The cards are beautifully printed, and you are quite a man of business
in the kite line. But about those "fidgets," what do mother and sisters
think of them? You must try to keep cool. By all means, send Mrs.
Richardson some picture cards or nicely printed reward cards, with any
back numbers of <span class="smcap">Young People</span> you can spare, and the books you mention.
She will find a use for them.</p>

<p>I like all the stories in <span class="smcap">Young People</span> so much that I can not make
a choice. I have a little sister whose name is Flora. She is four
years old, and I am eleven. We each have a swing. Hers is in the
grape arbor, and mine is under a large apple-tree. I had a pet
kitten about two years ago, and called it Daisy. Sometimes when we
were eating, and I moved my head, she would jump upon my back, and
pull and bite away at my hair as if she were going to pull it off;
and as that was not polite, I always made her jump down. One
morning when papa went out to feed Bill, the horse, he found her
dead before the barn door.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have seen so many letters in Our Post-office Box, and thought
them so interesting, that I have resolved to try to write one
myself. I will tell you of an experiment I tried this morning.
Unlike most other girls, I can never find anything very interesting
to do. After awhile I remembered a picture I had seen in a
magazine, and I set to work to see if I could do what a little boy
in the picture was doing. I first took two or three pea pods, and
began to make a boat. I first opened the side of a pod, and took
out the peas, and then I stuck a pin through the end that I had
split open, putting the head downward. I then took a little piece
of a stick, and stuck it in the pea pod for a seat. It made a very
pretty boat.</p></blockquote>

in this paper the next time you feel that you don't know what to do
next.</p>

<p>I wish some of the correspondents, or the editor himself, would
inform me how to make a squirrel trap, for we are perfectly
infested with squirrels, and also with rats and mice. I live on a
little farm in a pretty little village called Menlo Park, and I am
sure that I would not be happy at all if I were in the city of San
Francisco. I am also sure that Master Robert C.&nbsp;W. would find that
he is very much mistaken in his wish to be there, could he make the
trial. I make visits once in a while to the city, and I am sure
that my little brothers and sister and I enjoy it much more than if

<p>Although squirrels are cunning little fellows, and in most cases it
would be a shame to kill them or to disturb them in any way, they do
sometimes appear in such numbers as to become pests. In this case simple
box or figure-four traps, such as every boy knows how to make, may be
used with success to catch them. Better still is the small-sized
steel-trap known as the Rat-Trap, arranged with bait hung above it.</p>

<p>The American cuckoo does not adopt the indolent and dishonest ways of
the European cuckoo about its nest. It lives in thick woods, and builds
a nest of sticks and grass on the branch of some low tree. Its eggs are
bright green, and it lays four or five. We are sorry to say that while
its food is chiefly insects, snails, and berries, it sometimes steals
and sucks the eggs of other birds. There are three kinds of cuckoo in
the United States. The commonest has a yellow bill about an inch long,
is greenish-brown above, and grayish below. One of the world's great
poets, Wordsworth, wrote some beautiful stanzas addressed to this bird,
in which he asked whether it were really a bird or only a wandering
voice. It is very shy and solitary, but its note is cheery in the spring
and summer.</p>

should be gathered when in fine condition. Lay them smoothly between
large sheets of newspaper, and cover them with a heavy weight, changing
the paper once in three or four days. Some varieties of moss may be best
preserved by simply shaking out in the air and drying.</p>

<p>The most delicate liquid perfume for the handkerchief is cologne, which
is made by distilling balm, mint, lavender, rose leaves, and other sweet
things in alcohol. The best cologne is imported, and bears the name of
Jean Maria Farina, but it is expensive, and very good cologne indeed is
made by many of our druggists at a less cost. The nicest sachet powder
for clothing, note-paper, and other uses is pulverized orris root. This
smells like violets; and if you make little bags, fill them with orris
powder, and keep them in your bureau drawers and boxes, you will be sure
to have a faint flower-like fragrance about you wherever you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eva G</span>.&mdash;We do not know that stamps have anything which can be called a
language, like the language of flowers. They are conveniences invented
to help the correspondence of the world along. At a glance you perceive
that it would not be possible for all the people who write letters to
pay money for them, because that would cause a great deal of delay. We
place a stamp on the corner of the letter, and that represents the money
which was spent for the stamp. The money goes to the government to pay
the expenses of the postal service.</p>

<p>As to your little verse, we could easily translate it for you, but
prefer to let you do it for yourself, partly because, if you are
studying French, it will be a pleasant exercise, and partly, too,
because this Post-office Box is meant for young people who read English,

<p><span class="smcap">Eddy A</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Barometer</span>.&mdash;About two hundred years ago an Italian named
Torricelli was making some experiments to find out why fluids would rise
up in tubes when the air was drawn out. He filled a glass tube
thirty-three inches long, and open at one end, with mercury, and then he
put his finger over it to keep the mercury in, turned it bottom upward
into a bowl of mercury, and took away his finger. As mercury is very
heavy, it would seem as though it would have run out of the tube into
the bowl, but it did not; it fell a little way, and remained stationary
in the tube. He found that it rose and fell with the changes of the
weather, being affected by the pressure of the outside air. All the
barometers that have been made since Torricelli have been on his plan.
It may give you a hint for the one you think of making.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 17em;">A good-sized rat and very small mouse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Sat on the edge of the horse's manger,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Never giving a thought to danger.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Bow-wow! Bow-wow-wow!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Barked Mr. Dog to Pussy Meow:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"I'm going to catch that rat, while you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Can have the mouse to make a stew."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Meow-meow! Fiss! Scat!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">To the woolly dog replied the cat:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Just give your tail a gentle swing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">When you're quite ready to make the spring."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Tweak, tweak! Tweakety, tweak!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Squeaked the rat to the mouse so weak:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"That woolly dog and little cat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Will try to catch us, I'm sure of that."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"Eak, weak! Eakety, weak!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Replied the mouse, in a fainter squeak:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"We'd better not wait for it to be tried;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Let's jump down now and run and hide."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The woolly dog gave his tail a swing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The little cat made a terrible spring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The mouse disappeared through a hole in the floor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The rat scampered out through the open door.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The doggy silently scratched his ear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">The pussy sighed and dropped a tear.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"It's all your fault," said the dog, in a huff,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"You cats never move quickly enough."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"'Tis no such thing," was pussy's reply;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">"I moved as quick as the flash of an eye.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Your own lazy tail is all to blame;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">If <i>it</i> had wagged quicker, we'd have caught the game."</span><br />

<p><b>Fire-crackers.</b>&mdash;Fire-crackers are made in China, where, on account of
the cheapness of labor, the price is only two cents a bunch. As there
are eighty in a pack, a Chinaman makes forty fire-crackers for less than
a cent of our money. Most of them are made by poor people in their spare
time. Merchants in Hong-Kong buy them, and place them in boxes holding
forty packs each. They are so cheap that shippers could not afford to
pay much for having them carried, so they are used as ballast in ships
that bring silks and teas. The Chinese letters printed on the wrappers
of fire-cracker packs are the advertisements of the dealers.
"Fire-bangs," as they are sometimes called, are used almost all over the
world. In the United States, their use in the North is on the Fourth of
July; but in the South, Christmas is the great time for them. In
England, they are most popular on the 5th of November, Guy Fawkes's Day;
and in South America, on days of Church festivals. In China, everybody
fires them on New-Year's Day; and in some of the Chinese cities they can
be heard at almost all hours of every day, because the people think the
noise of their explosion will frighten away evil spirits.</p>
